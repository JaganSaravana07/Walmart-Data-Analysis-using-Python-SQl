## Project Overview
![Walmart Project Workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d39df17b-d051-45b1-bd6b-865ed6a560fa)
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis solution aimed at uncovering key business insights from Walmart sales data. It leverages Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to address critical business questions. Designed for data analysts, this project helps develop expertise in data manipulation, SQL querying, and building efficient data pipelines.
## End-to-End Data Processing and SQL Analytics Workflow:
-- **1. Data Exploration**
- Goal: Perform an initial assessment of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and potential issues.
- Analysis: Utilize functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to review column names, data types, and summary statistics.

6. Data Cleaning
Remove Duplicates: Detect and eliminate duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
Handle Missing Values: Drop insignificant missing data or fill in essential values where required.
Fix Data Types: Ensure consistency in data types (e.g., converting dates to datetime and prices to float).
Format Currency: Use .replace() to clean and standardize currency values for analysis.
Validation: Perform a final review to identify and resolve any inconsistencies.
7. Feature Engineering
Create New Columns: Compute the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and add it as a new feature.
Enhance Dataset: Introducing this calculated field facilitates advanced SQL analysis and aggregation.
8. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
Set Up Connections: Establish connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy.
Table Creation: Automate table setup and data insertion in both databases using Python SQLAlchemy.
Verification: Execute basic SQL queries to confirm accurate data loading.
9. SQL Analysis: Advanced Queries for Business Insights
Business Problem-Solving: Design and run complex SQL queries to derive valuable business insights, such as:
Revenue trends across branches and product categories.
Identifying top-selling product categories.
Analyzing sales performance based on time, city, and payment method.
Determining peak sales periods and customer purchasing behaviors.
