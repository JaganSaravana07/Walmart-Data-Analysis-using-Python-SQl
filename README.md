# Walmart Data Analysis using Python & SQl
## Project Overview
![Walmart Project Workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d39df17b-d051-45b1-bd6b-865ed6a560fa)
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis solution aimed at uncovering key business insights from Walmart sales data. It leverages Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to address critical business questions. Designed for data analysts, this project helps develop expertise in data manipulation, SQL querying, and building efficient data pipelines.
## End-to-End Data Processing and SQL Analytics Workflow:
### 1. Data Exploration
- Goal: Perform an initial assessment of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and potential issues.
- Analysis: Utilize functions like .info(), .describe(), and .head() to review column names, data types, and summary statistics.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Remove Duplicates: Detect and eliminate duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
- Handle Missing Values: Drop insignificant missing data or fill in essential values where required.
- Fix Data Types: Ensure consistency in data types (e.g., converting dates to datetime and prices to float).
- Format Currency: Use .replace() to clean and standardize currency values for analysis.
- Validation: Perform a final review to identify and resolve any inconsistencies.
### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create New Columns: Compute the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying unit_price by quantity and add it as a new feature.
- Enhance Dataset: Introducing this calculated field facilitates advanced SQL analysis and aggregation.
### 4. Load Data into MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Set Up Connections: Establish connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy.
- Table Creation: Automate table setup and data insertion in both databases using Python SQLAlchemy.
- Verification: Execute basic SQL queries to confirm accurate data loading.
### 5. SQL Analysis: Advanced Queries for Business Insights
- Business Problem-Solving: Design and run complex SQL queries to derive valuable business insights, such as:
- Revenue trends across branches and product categories.
- Identifying top-selling product categories.
- Analyzing sales performance based on time, city, and payment method.
- Determining peak sales periods and customer purchasing behaviors.
## PSQL Business Queries
1. What is the total sales revenue for each branch?
2. Which are the top 5 best-selling product categories?
3. What is the average customer rating for each payment method?
4. At what time do sales peak during the day?
5. Which cities generate the highest revenue?
6. Which branch has the highest profit margin?
7. How do sales trends change on a monthly basis?
8. What is the most preferred payment method among customers?
## MySQL Business Queries
1. How many transactions occur in each branch?
2. Which product category generates the highest revenue?
3. How does revenue change on a monthly basis?
4. Which customers have spent the most?
5. How does sales performance vary by day of the week?
6. What is the most preferred payment method in each city?
7. Which branch generates the highest total sales?
8. On which day was the highest total sales recorded?

## Results and Insights
- Sales Insights: Identify top-performing categories, branches with the highest sales, and the most preferred payment methods.
- Profitability Analysis: Examine the most profitable product categories and high-revenue locations.
- Customer Behavior: Analyze trends in customer ratings, payment preferences, and peak shopping hours.

## Future Enhancements
- Interactive Dashboards: Integrate with visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau for dynamic reporting.
- Data Enrichment: Incorporate additional data sources to provide deeper insights.
- Automation: Implement real-time data ingestion and processing for seamless analysis.
